<p><strong>File Notes:</strong> For DraftKings files, ensure you're using the downloaded contest file. For custom files, ensure your CSV columns match the required format for the selected sport and game type.</p>
<p>If uploading a custom file, the first N columns should be the length of a lineup, similar to how most sites will export lineups.</p>
<p>For example: if uploading Classic NBA, then the first 8 columns should be: <p>PG  SG  SF  PF  C  G  F  UTIL</p>
<p>Similarly, if uploading PGA, then the first 6 columns should be: <p>G  G  G  G  G  G</p></p>
<p><strong>Please note: file names, column names, and length of files are irrelavant. Any columns afterwards (salary, FPTS, ownership, etc.) will be discarded as they are not necessary for this tool.</strong></p>
